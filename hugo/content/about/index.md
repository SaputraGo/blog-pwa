# Hi.

I'm Justin Ribeiro. I'm a software engineer working on the open web, internet of things, and a wide range of applications. You may also know me for my goalkeeping coaching or my photography. I try to keep it interesting.

For the last 10 years, I've run a company I co-founded called [Stickman Ventures](https://www.stickmanventures.com). We build software for folks and other things.

For the last few years, I've been [Google Developer Expert](https://developers.google.com/experts/people/justin-ribeiro) in Web Technologies, Internet of Things and Wearables. I give a lot of talks and write a lot of words in attempt to make the developer experience better.

I also try to be active where I live. I've been doing my best to bring internet to those who can't afford it by starting and operating the [Oakdale OpenMesh](https://www.oakdaleopenmesh.org). I have served as President and on the board at the [Oakdale Chamber of Commerce](https://www.oakdalechamber.com) and sit on the [City of Oakdale](http://www.oakdalegov.com/) Economic Development Committee.

## Hello, nice to meet you.

I'm happy to talk. You can reach me on places like [Twitter](https://twitter.com/justinribeiro), [Google+](https://plus.google.com/+JustinRibeiro), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinribeiro).

You can also send me an email (justin@justinribeiro.com) if that's more you thing.
